# Implementation of deep CNN - ResNets

I built a deep convolutional neural network, using Residual Networks (ResNets). We know that deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, allow us to train much deeper networks.

In this project, we will:

- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification (digits representation with human finger).
